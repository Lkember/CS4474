# CS4474
Group Repository for HCI - Group project: Redesign a web game

REQUIREMENTS
-------------

You will need NPM
So type this command into your terminal MAC/Linux environment

	npm install

then you will need react-router which is the component of react that handles "page" navigation:

	cd CS4474
	cd arithmetic-app
	npm install react-router@3

*Please note that the latest version of react-router is version 4. However, version 4 is a complete rewrite of the library and will provide conflicts with our code that uses v3.

Should time allow we could migrate to version 4 down the line, however for now make sure you are installing version 3 (hence react-router@3)*


EXECUTING
----------

Simply ensure you are in the arithmetic-app subdirectory

	cd CS4474
	cd arithmetic-app
	npm start
